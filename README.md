# Advent of Code 2022

this is my scrap paper kind of project to help me organize code for Advent of Code 2022 - https://adventofcode.com/

This project shows my answers in a nice chart looking thing using React.

Seems like a fun way to look back and remember the puzzles.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Blog in a readme

- Puzzle 1 : Elves need special star fruit for reindeer. They can only get it in the jungle. This is an epic elven journey across the jungle. (The stars you get when you complete puzzles. Cute tie in.) - Must calculate how much food the Elves are carrying to be prepared. Prepared for what though?
